1. I'll be trying to use MCTS as an algorithm

2. Need to figure out a heuristic for maximum play, for use when simulating a leaf node using MCTS

3. Keep track of time and memory left (time i figured, memory unsure)

4. Move and prune and redo the Monte Carlo Tree accordingly as the game progresses, so as to save space
and also to make the algorthm more efficient.
